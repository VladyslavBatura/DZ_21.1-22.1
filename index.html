        <p class="description">Ford and Harley-Davidson have established a unique partnership in the auto industry. The latter has a long history of building custom and special edition H-D branded trucks, and the latest example of that is the 2019 Ford F-150 Harley-Davidson Concept Truck. Developed as a special edition version of the F-150 Super Crew trim, the new F-150 Harley-Davidson Concept was created with the help of Tuscany, a subsidiary of Fox Factory Inc. and a Ford Motor Company specialty vehicle manufacturer in the personal-use segment, to help celebrate the bikemaker’s 115th anniversary.</p>

        <p class="description"><strong>What Makes The Ford F-150 Harley-Davidson Concept Special</strong></p>
        <p>The two titans of their respective industries are iconic in their own right. What better way, then, to celebrate that status than by joining forces to create the ultimate machinery. Ok, so the 2019 Ford F-150 Harley-Davidson Concept Truck isn’t exactly the ultimate machinery. It’s not even the first product of the Ford-Harley partnership; there have been numerous great collaborations between the two companies, including the early 2000s supercharged F-150s and the larger F-250 and F-350 models which got the HD treatment over the years. But don’t sleep on the new kid on the block, either. The 2019 Ford F-150 Harley-Davison Concept is a beast in its own right.</p>
        <p class="description">As you might expect from a Ford-Harley collaboration that also involves custom company Tuscany Motors, the F-150 Harley-Davidson Concept is loaded to the brim with upgrades. This is more than just a heavily dressed-up pickup with Harley badges spread throughout its body. This is a pickup that was designed to represent Harley’s ‘Fat Boy’ motorcycle range, a tip of the cap to the motorcycle brand’s iconic line of softail cruisers. Aesthetic and functional upgrades are all over this pickup, including the custom fender flares, functional fender vents, a replacement custom grille with a honeycomb mesh, a front bumper cap with its own skid plate, and a replacement functional ram-air hood that comes with its own Ford Raptor-style insert. The custom pickup also features lighted power deploying running boards with its own integrated rocker trim. If these items and components aren’t enough, Harley-Davidson and Tuscany Motors also fitted the heavy-duty pickup with a set of 22-inch Harley-Davidson branded Fat Boy-style milled aluminum wheels wrapped in massive 35-inch all-terrain tires.</p>
        <p class="description">The interior also gets dressed up in a two-tone, diamond-stitched perforated custom leather treatment. Harley-Davidson-branded items are also featured in the interior, specifically the stainless steel gauges, billet racing pedals, floor mats, bed rug, and door entry sills. Oh, and there’s also another badge on the pickup’s center console, one that proudly displays the official number of the custom pickup relative to its total allocation.On the more functional side, Tuscany Motors and Harley-Davidson fitted the pickup with a custom tuned Flowmaster exhaust with exclusive solid billet aluminum tips and a custom tuned BDS suspension lift kit with upgraded shocks from Fox Factory Inc., the parent firm of Tuscany Motors.</p>

        <p class="description">There’s no information regarding any power and performance upgrades, but Jeff Burttschell, Tuscany owner and vice-president of sales, indicated that “the Harley-Davidson F-150 will be offered on the 2019 F-150 Super Crew with either the 5.0-liter V8 or 3.5-liter EcoBoost.”</p>
        <p class="description">“It will also be offered in both 4×4 and 4×2 drivelines,” Burttschell added.</p>
        <p class="description">Take that for what that’s worth.</p>
